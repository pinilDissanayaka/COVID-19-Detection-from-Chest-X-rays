# COVID-19-Detection-from-Chest-X-rays

## Overview:
In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims to empower deep learning and AI enthusiasts to actively contribute to the advancement of medical research. By utilizing Chest X-rays, we provide a straightforward directory structure comprising training and testing sets, each divided into three classes. The images within these classes serve as valuable data for training models to detect COVID-19, thus aiding the medical and research communities in combating the pandemic.

## Directory Structure:
The project follows a simple directory structure, categorized into "train" and "test" sets. Within these, you will find subdirectories representing three distinct classes relevant to the COVID-19 detection task. This organization facilitates easy access and understanding of the dataset, supporting efficient model training and testing.

### Train

Class 1: Normal

Class 2: Pneumonia

Class 3: COVID-19

### Test

Class 1: Normal

Class 2: Pneumonia 

Class 3: COVID-19

## Acknowledgements:
We extend our gratitude to the University of Montreal for generously releasing the chest X-ray images used in this project. Their contribution allows us to create a meaningful dataset for training and testing deep learning models, facilitating collaborative efforts in the fight against COVID-19.

## Inspiration:
The primary inspiration behind this project is to harness the collective power of the AI and deep learning community to make a tangible impact on the current health crisis. By providing a platform for enthusiasts to engage in COVID-19 detection research, we aim to bridge the gap between technology and medicine. We encourage participants to share their work, insights, and findings with the wider medical and research communities, fostering collaboration and accelerating progress in the field.
